Grails 3.2.3

# Initialisation
Created using grails create-app ReviCApp

# Requirements:
App to help school students with GCSE or A Level revision.  The app will be web-based but downloadable on mobile (a progressive web app).  The user will be able to select a subject (including exam board and series) to revise, then a topic within that subject, then a sub-topic.  For the selected sub-topic, the user will be presented with a set of sequential activities (text information to read with questions, pictures/diagrams/video with questions, some exercises with worked solutions, an interactive game).  Progress is tracked and when the user is ready they can take a revision test, which is a combination of multiple choice and written answer questions.  Written answers are marked using text comparison with key terms taken from a model answer.  The test is scored and the score is added to the user's progress (this will show the number of completed activities and the test score for the topic).
